# FormSubmissions

this is made to autosubmit forms to various sites. such as survey forms
it should test the site in with regular http post request, and grab the information with get requests, and if it can't submit (for reasons such as it requires a captcha or something) it'll then try to do it in a web driver.

i'll be working on the code whenever i'm broed and remember it :3

Big Shoutout to ArachnidInner. They helped me without realizing!!!
(AKA: I Stole some of their code to get this to work :3 but it works now!!!)
